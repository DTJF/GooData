Welcome to *GooData* project,

a library to generate 2D data plots

- as line graph,
- bar chart,
- pie chart, or
- vector field

providing advanced features like markers, perpendiculars, whiskers or
filled areas. Follow the links to find a detailed description [in
English](http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=19760) or
[in German](https://www.freebasic-portal.de/projekte/goodata-65.html).
Perhaps you want to check some examples (source code and output) in the
[online documentation
Gallery](http://users.freebasic-portal.de/tjf/GooData/doc/html/GooData-gallery.html).

It's not a finished project. The code isn't well testet, and the ToDo
list is still long. Currently there's no further progress here. The
code is published in a quick and dirty way because I was asked to do
so.

Have fun!
